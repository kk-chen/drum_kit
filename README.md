# drum_kit
First project of JavaScript 30 day challenge
#
Creates a "drum kit" on the keyboard line from A to L that plays a drum sound. <br />
When the key is pressed, the sound plays.  Additionally, the box of the corresponding letter and sound is highlighted around the border and made slightly bigger so it "pops" to the eye.
